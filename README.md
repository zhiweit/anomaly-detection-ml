# anomaly-detection-ml
This is a machine learning project done to classify whether a user is anomalous or normal. This is meant to showcase my machine learning experience for getting an internship. This is a temporary repository meant for employers to view and will be removed to prevent future students from reusing the code as the project may be reused next semester.
